Geochemical anomaly identification and gold deposits prospect prediction based on coding theory

  At present, the use of geological big data and machine learning methods to achieve mineralization related geochemical anomaly identification and gold deposits prospect prediction has achieved some results, but many potential machine learning methods have not yet been explored. 

  In this worl, we use machine learning methods such as automatic encoder, variational autoencoder, dictionary learning and sparse coding model based on coding ideas to extract anomalies from geochemical data in Jiaodong, Shandong Province. These methods learn the partial characteristics of the data, encoding and reconstruct the original data, and then identify the multivariate geochemical anomalies related to the gold deposits. The conclusion shows that the method based on the coding theory can be used to identify geochemical anomalies. Most known gold deposits are located in the areas with high reconstruction error or high feature numbers, indicating that these anomalies are closely related to gold deposits. 

  By comparing and discussing these methods of coding theory, it is considered that the performance of geochemical anomaly detection using variational autoencoder model is relatively the best. Using this method to carry out regional gold deposits prospect prediction has more reliable results. At the end of the study, we combined with the geological background of the study area and the results of anomaly detection, then put forward a prediction of the gold deposits prospects.
