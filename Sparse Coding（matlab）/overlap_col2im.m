% Recover overlapping (bb x bb) patches into an image reconstruction

% X: (bb^2 x N) matrix containing the vectorised signals
% Mask: (bb^2 x N) matrix containing the vectorised mask. Each column is the mask of the corresponding column of X
% bb: patch size
% overlap: number of pixels between consecutive patches
% im_size: tuple of original image dimensions  原始图像尺寸的元组

M = im_size(2);

% Initialise the image

% Initialise the matrix that stores the cumulative signal used to calculate
% each pixel

% Calculate how many patches fit horisontally and vertically

% access next
